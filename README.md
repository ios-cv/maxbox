MaxBox open-source hardware
====================

This repository is for the 3D design files, KiCad PCB design/Gerber files, and ESP-IDF firmware files to produce a MaxBox control box. This takes the form of a 100mm diameter circular PCB with a Mifare antenna, buck converter capable of up to 36V DC input, RGB LEDs, high speed CAN bus transceiver, an ESP32-WROVER castellated module incorporating a Bluetooth and WiFi antenna, and GPIO to connect buttons and relays.
